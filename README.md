# Gameboy LCD to VGA adapter

This repository contains code for building the VGA adapter as decribed in my talk at SEC-T: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afctHEtqS2c
The code is currently written for a commercial FPGA using the Quartus II IDE but the plan is to rewrite this for the iCEBreaker FPGA using open source tools and updating the output from VGA to HDMI.


## TODO

* Port the current code to the iCEBreaker
* Add support for HDMI instead of VGA
* Add direct capture of LCD signal over USB
